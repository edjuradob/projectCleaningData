The rest of column names contains the features (only means and standard deviations) following the next conventions:

*All names are lowcase
*names follows the next format:
	prefixfeature_measure_axis
	where:
	preffix: (t or f)
		*t preffix reffers to time
		*f prefix reffers to frequency
	feature (bounded between -1 and 1):
		the name of the feature measured
	measure: (mean or standard deviation)
		*means are suffixed with _mean
		*standard deviations are suffixed with _std
	axis (optional): (x, y or z)
