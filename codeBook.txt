Tidy Data Set for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

**************************************************
This Data Set has been cleaned and put toguether from different files from the original data creating this sumarized data set.

It cointains:

subject: The subject who performed the activity (30 subjects, identify by numbers from 1 to 30)
activity: The activity performed for which was the features measured

The rest of column names contains the features (only means and standard deviations) following the next conventions:

*All names are lowcase
*names follows the next format:
	prefixfeature_measure_axis
	where:
	preffix: (t or f)
		*t preffix reffers to time
		*f prefix reffers to frequency
	feature (bounded between -1 and 1):
		the name of the feature measured
	measure: (mean or standard deviation)
		*means are suffixed with _mean
		*standard deviations are suffixed with _std
	axis (optional): (x, y or z)
		the coordinate axis of the measurement

Example
for time of bodyacc mean in coordinate x, the name will be:
	tbodyacc_mean_x
	

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
